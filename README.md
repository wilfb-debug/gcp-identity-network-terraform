# Identity-First Cloud Network (Terraform) + Observability

## Project Scope (Identity-First Infrastructure)

This project demonstrates an identity-first cloud architecture on Google Cloud
built entirely with Terraform.

### What this project proves
- No public IP access to workloads
- Access controlled by IAM identities, not networks
- Infrastructure deployed using least-privilege service accounts
- Private VM access via IAP (no SSH from the internet)
- Observability implemented using Cloud Logging and Monitoring

### Architecture Components
- VPC with private subnet
- Private Compute Engine VM
- IAP-based access (identity-aware proxy)
- Centralized Cloud Logging
- Log-based metrics and alerting

This project builds an identity-first networking pattern on Google Cloud using Terraform, then validates telemetry (logs) from a 
private VM and sets up alerting.

## What this demonstrates
- Private VM access via IAP (no public IP required)
- IAM-first approach (least privilege)
- Centralized logging (Cloud Logging)
- Log-based metric + alerting (Cloud Monitoring)

## Architecture (high level)
- VPC + subnets (private workload subnet)
- Private VM (no public IP)
- IAP TCP forwarding to SSH into the VM
- Cloud Logging ingests syslog/app logs from the VM
- Log-based metric counts matching events (STEP3_TEST)
- Cloud Monitoring alert notifies when threshold is met

## Validation evidence
- Logs appear in Cloud Logging under `jsonPayload.message`
- Filter used: see `observability/log-filter.txt`
- Metric created: `step3_test_count` (log-based metric)
- Alert policy created: `TEST ALERT`

## Repo structure
- `terraform/` - Terraform IaC
- `architecture/` - architecture diagrams and write-ups
- `observability/` - log filter, metric + alert notes
- `screenshots/` - screenshots as proof/evidence

# Identity-First Cloud Architecture with Terraform (GCP)

![Identity-First Cloud Architecture](architecture/identity-first-architecture.png)

This project demonstrates designing and deploying a secure, identity-first cloud architecture on Google Cloud Platform using Terraform.

## Key Concepts
- Identity-first access using IAM and service accounts
- Private networking using VPCs and firewall rules
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Secure service-to-service communication

## Architecture Principles

- No public access by default
- Least-privilege IAM
- Network segmentation
- Repeatable infrastructure via Terraform

## Identity Model

This project separates identities by responsibility:

- Human identity: used for administrative setup only
- Terraform service account: used to provision infrastructure via Infrastructure as Code
- Runtime service account: used by workloads to access dependent services

This separation enforces least privilege and reduces blast radius.

## Terraform outputs (post-Apply)

```text
private_subnet = "private-subnet"
public_subnet  = "public-subnet"
vpc_name       = "identity-net"

## Observability and Alerting

This project implements workload-level observability using Google Cloud Logging
and log-based metrics.

Application logs are emitted from a private Compute Engine VM and ingested into
Cloud Logging. A log-based metric is created to count matching log entries, and
an alerting policy is attached to this metric.

### Alert Validation Notes

During testing, application logs were successfully ingested into Cloud Logging
and observed incrementing the associated log-based metric.

Due to Cloud Monitoring evaluation timing and notification delivery behavior,
the alert notification itself was not relied upon for validation.

Instead, validation was confirmed via:
- Log presence in Logs Explorer
- Metric visibility and configuration
- Alert policy attachment and threshold settings

This mirrors real-world cloud engineering practices where alert behavior is
validated structurally rather than via test email delivery.

## Observability Validation

### Log Ingestion Proof
The following screenshot confirms application logs from a private VM are ingested into Cloud Logging and queryable via Logs 
Explorer.
