# Identity-First Cloud Architecture with Terraform (GCP)

This project demonstrates designing and deploying a secure, identity-first cloud architecture on Google Cloud Platform using Terraform.

## Key Concepts
- Identity-first access using IAM and service accounts
- Private networking using VPCs and firewall rules
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Secure service-to-service communication

## Architecture Principles

- No public access by default
- Least-privilege IAM
- Network segmentation
- Repeatable infrastructure via Terraform
